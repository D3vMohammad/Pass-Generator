# Pass-Generator

**1. Introduction:**

This JavaScript code snippet aims to generate secure random passwords with specified length and complexity requirements. It utilizes the `crypto` module for secure random number generation and provides flexibility in defining password complexity.

**2. Function Definition:**

The core functionality is encapsulated within the `generatePassword` function. This function takes two parameters: `length` (the desired length of the password) and `complexity` (an array indicating the desired complexity levels).

**3. Complexity Criteria:**

Four complexity levels are considered: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numeric digits, and special characters. These are represented by arrays of corresponding characters.

**4. Character Selection:**

The function constructs the password by selecting characters from the allowed character sets based on the specified complexity. It concatenates the selected character sets to form a pool of allowed characters.

**5. Error Handling:**

The code includes error handling to ensure that at least one complexity level is specified. If not, it throws an error indicating the requirement for specifying at least one complexity level.

**6. Password Generation:**

Using the pool of allowed characters, the function generates a random password of the specified length by iteratively selecting characters randomly.

**7. Default Settings:**

The code sets default parameters for password length and complexity. A default length of 16 characters is used, and all complexity levels (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numeric digits, and special characters) are included by default.

**8. Output:**

Upon successful password generation, the generated password is logged to the console.

**9. Error Handling:**

In case of any errors during password generation, such as invalid complexity criteria or other issues, the code utilizes a `try...catch` block to gracefully handle errors and log error messages to the console.
